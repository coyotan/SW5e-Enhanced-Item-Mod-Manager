## SW5e Enhanced Item Modification Manager
----
This module is built to work with the SW5e module (Not system) that plugs into DND5e for Foundry VTT 12.

It adds a "Modification" tag to chassis items, which functions as a 'container' for modification-type items. 

Modifications can be dragged onto the item based on the rules defined in SW5e, though there is a button for DMs to override behaviors like required rolls, or parts being destroyed on failure, in case those mechanics get in the way of fun.

### Warning
It has been many years since I did anything in js. This script is about 98% written by Google Gemini 3 Thinking in Canvas mode. It is versioned at 0.9.0 because I have not been over every line of code contained in this repo. Adjacent to this fact, I have not fully audited the code's functionality.

### Bugs
Following the above statement - if you find any bugs, please leave an issue documenting the issue and the steps to reproduce it. If you're feeling extra helpful - I will review pull requests!
